=head1 The Chemistry::Elements Perl 6 module

The Perl 5 version of Chemistry::Elements was my first module, so
I'm making it my first Perl 6 module too. It's not complicated.

=head2 Copyright and License

You should have received a I<LICENSE> file, but the license is also noted
in the module files. About the only thing you can't do is pretend that
you wrote code that you didn't.

=head2 Good luck!

Enjoy,
